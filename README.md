# Rice-Diseases-Diagnosis

Our goal is to provide a solution to discover some diseases that affect the rice plant, so we made
a mobile application that works to discover the rice diseases by inserting the image of the rice
and making some operations and algorithms using Tensorflow kares model and the MobileNet
algorithm to discover if it is infected with any disease or healthy and determine the type of disease
for a rice paper, for example, the BrownSpot, Hispa and Leaf Blast.
